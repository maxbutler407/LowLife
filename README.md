# LowLife
LowLife is a C++ passion project of mine, that I made over the Summer of 2024. It is a text-based RPG based in a world where sci-fi and fantasy are fused together in a gritty but fantastical world.

The game is essentially complete however, it still has some bugs and needs some rebalancing. Nevertheless, I am very happy with how it turned out and I hope that for those who play have fun.
This link will take you to a walkthrough of the game, but it didn't record the full screen (I couldn't find a way areound this without spending money), so it's a little tricky to follow: https://youtu.be/EdT7pCAIM78
